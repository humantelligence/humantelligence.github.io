  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The Humantelligence Platform Version 6.0 focus on the Talent Fit Module. This module has as purpose to support the current recruitment process on the client company.</p>

<p>It puts together the candidates cultural profiles, to match that information with the the company’s
culture, the direct manager profile and a occupational profile and then
rank the candidates based on the Summarized Match Score.</p>

<p>With Talent Fit, the admin/recruiter will have more information to provide insights on the candidate selection. In addition, Talent Fit optimize the selection process increasing the probability of successfull employee adquisition.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="elements-of-talent-fit">Elements of Talent Fit</h2>

<p>Talent Fit put together several Elements and Concepts to support the
selection process:
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="positions">Positions</h3>

<p>Positions are the open positions available on the company. Each position
is related with a <code>Job Family</code>.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="candidates">Candidates</h3>

<p>Candidates can be <em>Current Employess</em> (already members with Scan
Completed) or <em>New Members</em>.</p>

<p>Each candidate have to complete the Scan to be ranked on the selection
process. In order to support this, the recruiter can invite candidates
to complete the scan sending an email invitation.</p>

<p>Each candidate is esentially a individual user on the HT Platform under the Client’s Features Module Setup. At least, each candidate will have the following functionalities available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profile Page</li>
  <li>Network</li>
  <li>User Settings</li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference from the Candidate perspective is that the Candidate
Profile include the name of the Position is running to and the <code>Four Fit
Factors Scores</code>.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="matching-and-scoring">Matching and Scoring</h3>

<p>The TalentFit match, scores and rank the candidates based on Four Fit
Factors as Follows:</p>

<h4 id="fit-factors"><em>Fit Factors</em></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Humantelligence Ideal Profile Benchmark</li>
  <li><strong>Manager</strong>: Direct Report</li>
  <li><strong>Group</strong>: Group Culture</li>
  <li><strong>Employee Performance</strong>: Employee Incumbent Data</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Fit Factor is a representation of a cultural profile, the same as
each candidate have a cultural profile. Each factor is compared against
the candidate profile and based on the similarities, each candidate get
points.</p>

<p>After each candidate completes the HT Scan or everytime a current
employee is added as a candidate, the system run the calculations and
rank the entire candidate list in descent order based on the number of
points.</p>

<p>Talent Fit, clasify the candidates in 4 groups based on the matching
score as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="background-color: lightgreen">     </span>   Very High Similarity (8 - 10 points)</li>
  <li><span style="background-color: green">     </span>   High Similarity (6 - 7 points)</li>
  <li><span style="background-color: yellow">     </span>   Moderate Similarity (3 - 5 points)</li>
  <li><span style="background-color: red">     </span>   Low Similarity (0 - 2 points)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to setup what is the culture profile for the Open Position,
Talent Fit use weights over the Four Fit Factors, that means, the
recruiter can assign an specific weight to each Factor.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="job-family">Job Family</h3>

<p>One of the more important Fit Factors is the <code>Occupation</code>. Depends on
the Job Family related with the Open Position, the recruiter will be
able to select an Occupation with represent a cultural profile against
the candidate’s cultural profiles will be compared to.</p>

<p>The Job Families available are based on HT Benchmarks gather from Market
 Studies and Experts Judgement.

through the whole cycle of candidates selection.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="position-list">Position List</h3>

<p>The Position List is the easiest way to have a big picture of the
current positions on the system.</p>

<p>This list shows the current state of the positions on the systems, including:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Code</strong>:</td>
      <td>Position Code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Position</strong>:</td>
      <td>Position Name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Open Positions</strong>:</td>
      <td>Number of open positions in the system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Candidates</strong>:</td>
      <td>Number of candidates related with the position.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Profiles Completed</strong>:</td>
      <td>Percentage of candidates with profiles completed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* <strong>Group</strong>:</td>
      <td>Group where the candidate need to fit in.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
